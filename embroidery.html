      <h2>What is embroidery</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="right" width="250px" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/embroideryimage.jpg" alt="" /> Embroidery is the process of adding thread to a cloth to add a pattern or image .Using an embroidery machine you can write text with thread on cloth
        surfaces or draw images to make logos or patches! You can also embroider different colours by layering.
        <br /><br />An embroidery machine looks like a regular sewing machine however it has a motorized bed that moves along the x-y axes with an automated needle.
        <br /> It can embroider (print) only one colour at a time. Will have to replace the spool of thread each time you want a new colour.
        <h2>Creating an embroider design</h2>
        <p>
          We use a program called PE-DESIGN NEXT 9 to make embroidery designs.The program is found on the computer attached to the sewing machine.

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Begin by creating a new file<br />
            <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9createfile.png" alt="" /> Changing the view mode to Realistic in the View tab makes it easier to work with the program!
            <br /> <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9view.png" alt="" />

          </li>
          <li>
            You can insert shapes into the work area (the big white box in the center) by selecting a shape and then holding and dragging to draw the shape you want. If you do not see the shapes button, switch over to the Home tab.
            <br /> <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9shape.png" alt="" />

          </li>
          <li>
            Change the colours.<br /> Click on the shape then in the <b>Attributes</b> tab, then click on the spool and select the colour you want it to be in the side panel. You can do this too to change the colour of the outline.
            <br /> <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9savecolor.png" alt="" />
            <br />
            <b>Note: </b>Make sure all your colours are consistent throughout. (Don’t have 3 different shades of blue if you want the same blue throughout the print)
            <br />The more colours you add, the longer it will take to embroider and more spool changes you will need to do.
            <br /> <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9pickcolor.png" alt="" />

          </li>
          <li>
            Changing Stitch Pattern.<br />You can also change the stitch pattern in the attributes tab to get different effects to your design.
            <br /> <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9changestich.png" alt="" /> Here you can see some of the different stitch patterns, there are also different stitch patterns for the outline.
            <br /> <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9stichpatterns.png" alt="" />

          </li>
          <li>
            Optimizing for Sewing Order<br />Since the embroidery machine can do only one colour at a time, it is important to optimize the file to do all the same colours at once. We can do this by grouping the same coloured layers together in the sewing
            order panel on the left.
            <br /> <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9sewingorder.png" alt="" /> You can see that this order we have in the example is inefficient since you would need to take the black spool off and then put it back on
            later. Instead you can do the black all at once and have to change the spool colour 3 times instead of 4.


          </li>
          <li>
            Finishing up<br />
          Save your work.Go to the <b>Home</b> tab. Plug in your machine to the computer. Send your deisng to the machine.
          <br /> <img class="image-list" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9senddesign.png" alt="" />

      <h2>Using the Embroidery Machine: Brother HE240
</h2>
<p>
  The embroidery machine is very finicky and needs everything to be right to operate properly.<br /><br />
<b>Precautions before use:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make sure you are using a 75/11 needle

    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure the embroidery attachment is installed

    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure the bobbin has a thread in it

    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure there’s nothing obstructing the way of the loop’s path

    </li>
    <li>
      Do not sew when there is no thread

    </li>
    <li>
      Do not sew when there is no fabric to sew on

    </li>
    <li>
      Be patient but have fun!

    </li>
  </ul>

</p>
<h3>Operations checklist</h3>
<p>
  Before operating the machine, you need to set it up to get it working. Make sure that:
<ul class="b">
  <li >
    The machine is threaded properly and the thread is through the needle

  </li>
  <li>
    The bobbin is not empty

  </li>
  <li>
    The foot is down

  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Turning on the machine</h3>
<p>
  The power switch is found on the side of the machine.
  <br />
  You will be prompted a message after turning it on, hit OK
</p>

<img class="imgagegrid" style="max-width:300px; border:solid 3px;border-color: #5f9ea0"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9prompt.png" alt="" />
</center>

<h3>Threading the machine</h3>
<p>
  There are two pre-steps that come before those numbered on the machine.
</p>
<ol class="c">
  <li>
    Insert the spool of thread into the long pin.
<br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9spoolthread.jpg" alt="" />

  </li>
  <li>
    Place a spool cover on top of the spool.  Make sure you use a spool cover that’s bigger than the spool.
    <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next9spoollid.jpg" alt="" />

  </li>
  <li>
    Before threading, make sure the needle is in its highest position. If not you will have to adjust the height with the knob show on the right side of the machine.
    <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next92-1.png" alt="" />

  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Note: It is advised that you use thread meant for embroidery. It would say embroidery on the spool, this yields higher quality results.
<br /><br />
<b>Now we are using the steps that are on the machine.</b>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Bring the string through the metal hook
    <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next91.png" alt="" />

  </li>
  <li>Continue bringing it underneath the plastic piece

    <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next92.png" alt="" />
    You can also see the visual guide on how to do this that is on the machine.

  </li>
  <li>
    Pull the thread down the side of the machine into the slot.
    <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next93.png" alt="" />
    Now take the thread and wrap it around the thin plastic U shaped part, pulling it all the way up.
    <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next93-1.png" alt="" />

  </li>
  <li>
    Keep pulling the thread up and then pull it toward the machine
    <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next94.png" alt="" />
  </li>
  <li>
    Then pull the thread down, you will notice that it will latch onto the metal piece on the inside
    <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next94-1.png" alt="" />

  </li>
<p>

<b>Note:</b> If the thread does not latch onto the metal piece, try again until it does
</p>

<li>
  Make sure the needle is in the highest position, then pull down the thread and latch it to the hook above the need labelled 6.
  <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next96.png" alt="" />

</li>
<li>
  Then pass the thread underneath the metal piece show in the picture and around the plastic part labelled 7.
  <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next97.png" alt="" />

</li>
<li>
  Almost done! Push down the lever, this should pass the thread through the needle. If it does not, you have to adjust the height of the needle using the knob on the side and try again.

  <br /><img class="image-list"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next98.png" alt="" />

</li>
<li>
  Finally pull the string from the needle and cut off the excess length. (Leave about 10cm) That’s it for threading the machine!
<center>
    <img class="imgagegrid"style="max-width:300px; border:solid 3px;border-color: #5f9ea0"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next99.png" alt="" /><img class="imgagegrid"style="max-width:300px; border:solid 3px;border-color: #5f9ea0"  title="Embroidery" src="pictures/next910.jpg" alt="" />
</center>
</li>
<p>
<b>  Note: </b>Do not pull the string out of the needle, only the excess part to cut it off

</p>
</ol>
<h2>
Rewinding the bobbin</h2>


<img class="right" style="width:35%;max-width:300px; border:solid 3px;border-color: #5f9ea0" title="Embroidery" src="pictures/rewindingbobbin.jpg" alt="" /><p>

  A sewing machine needs a feed of thread from the bottom too. Otherwise the thread wouldn’t stay onto what you’re sewing on.  You can see in the demonstration on the side how the bobbin role is important when it comes to sewing.
<br /><br />
The bobbin is found in the bottom of the machine and needs to be refilled every time it runs out, otherwise the machine will not sew.
<br /><br />
If the bobbin is empty, click <a href="bobbin.html">here</a> to the steps on rewinding the thread onto the bobbin. <br />
